If you’ve been learning **data analytics for months** but still feel stuck…

**You’re not lazy.  
You’re missing a system.**

---

### Maybe this sounds familiar

- You start courses but never finish them  
- You learn **SQL, Power BI, Python**… but don’t know what to do next  
- You save job roles but don’t apply consistently  
- You have project ideas that never get completed  
- You feel overwhelmed every time you try to *“plan”* your data career  

Most people don’t struggle because they **can’t learn**.  
They struggle because everything feels **scattered**.

I know this — because I’ve been there.

---

### My turning point

I landed my **first data analytics role in four months** —  
not because I was smarter or faster…

…but because I had:
- a **clear roadmap**
- and a **simple system for consistency**

I didn’t try to learn everything at once.  
I didn’t jump randomly between tools.  

I focused on:
- what to **learn**
- what to **build**
- what to **apply for**

**Week by week.**
